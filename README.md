# Gamers United

Gamers United is a platform for gamers to organize and sign up for local events, and get their gaming news. This plaform will allow users to come together and celebrate their love their love for whatever game they wish to play! Once the user visits the site, he or she will login and be able to choose to create an event, sign up for an event, or check out the most recent Esports news.

This application utilizes ReactJS, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Auth0, CSS, Bootstrap, and some HTML. Gamers United also utilizes a node package called Cheerio to scrape for Esports news. In order for users to engage with this application, he or she simply click the following link: **https://powerful-beyond-98279.herokuapp.com**.

Once the user gets to the landing page, the development team  recommends that users immediately login. Without logging in, users will not be able to create events, register for events, or save articles or other Esports news. Once the user logs in, he or she has a number of options: *Check Out Local Events*, *Create New Events*, and *Get Esports News*.

**Check Out Local Events** - If a user clicks on *Check Out Local Events*, he or she will be taken to a page full of all of the created events. The user can interact with each event via 2 buttons: See More Detail and Register Here. If the user clicks on 'See More Detail', the user can see how many people have signed up for the event, who has signed up, and other relevant information regarding to the event. If the user clicks on 'Register Here', he or she will be taken to a form which will register the user for the event upon completion.

**Create New Events** - If a user clicks on *Create a New Event*, the user will be able to fill out a form with details for a new event. Once the user submits their form, the event will show up in the 'Local Events' page so other users can register.

**Get Esports News** - If a user clicks on *Get all of Your Esports News*, he or she will be taken to a screen that automatically populates with the most recent Esports news from ESPN's Esports page. This ensures that users are up to date with the most relevant information. The user also has the ability to change what genre of news he or she wants to view. Users can view upcoming games by console on this screen.

Users can view all of their activity in their *User Profile* page. Once the user is **Signed In**, he or she can click on their name in the top right hand corner of the screen and see a summary of all their activity. 

There were a number of challenges that the team faced during development. The biggest challenge was getting Auth0 to work as expected. After a lot of research and trial & error, the group finally was able to get it working. The group worked very diligently with a lot of discipline to deliver a high quality result on time.

The team would like to give a special shout out to a major reason why this project was so successful - without the hard work and effort put into this project by Phelan Oneill, this project would have been set back much farther and would not be in the shape that it is. We wish Phelan a speedy recovery and we were honored to have him on our team.
